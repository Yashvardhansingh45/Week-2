// Sample Problem 2: School System with Different Roles
// Description: Create a hierarchy for a school system where Person is the superclass, and Teacher, Student, and Staff are subclasses.
// Tasks:
// Define a superclass Person with common attributes like name and age.
// Define subclasses Teacher, Student, and Staff with specific attributes (e.g., subject for Teacher and grade for Student).
// Each subclass should have a method like displayRole() that describes the role.
// Goal: Demonstrate hierarchical inheritance by modeling different roles in a school, each with shared and unique characteristics.
// Base class
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
    }
}
